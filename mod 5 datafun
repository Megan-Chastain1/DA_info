#Skill: Write Basic SQL Queries to Create and Query Data
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for working with relational databases.
We use SQL to:

Create tables

Insert data

Select and filter rows

Sort results for analysis

Knowing the core SQL commands helps you structure, explore, and retrieve data from a database. Knowing SQL well is a key data analyst skill - not so much memorizing - as understanding when and how to use SQL to get results. 

#Skill: Use Advanced SQL to Join, Update, and Summarize Data
Once youâ€™ve mastered the basics, SQL provides more power to combine, modify, and analyze data.

With advanced SQL, you can:

Join tables together using shared keys

Update or delete specific records

Group data and calculate summaries like totals and averages

These are core skills used every day by data analysts and database professionals.

Match each function to the SQL.
